 	External library: UtilitiesV.h
 	______________________________________________________________________________________________________
 
 	By: TheCorPlay
 	E-Mail: thecorplay@gmail.com
 	Current version: v0.1.4-beta
	______________________________________________________________________________________________________
	
	Since the v0.1.2-beta the library Utilities.h change the name to UtilitiesV.h
	This is because from now on, the library Utilities.h imports the library vector.
	If you do not want to import the vector library but want to use the library Utilities.h,
	you have a version available.
	Currently in v0.1.1-beta.

	MANUEL FREIRE MORAN:
		He created the split method based on vectors rather than arrays.
		It is a much more efficient and convenient method to use, but has to import vector.
